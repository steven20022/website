        <p>With production on the rise people moved north to find work in factories. Factories are not as glamorous as people at the time would believe. Though factories were a good source of money the factories themselves came with a whole new set of problems.
            Factory workers often had to work 14 - 16 hours a day with only one day off, but long hours were not the only things that these workers had to deal with. Unfair pay and hazardous work places were some of the things that they had to deal with
            along with heavily biased pay as men got paid double the amount the women would get and children which in its own right isn't a good thing don't get paid nearly as much as women. Back to the hazards of factories, the safety of the workers
            were nonexistent which led to many work place injuries and death, which as sad as it is was a common occurrence. With odds of dying in a factory being 1 in 50, to put that in perspective you had better chances surviving World War II with a
            death rate of 1 in 58. This neglegence was expecially true when it came to children. Due to their small frame they were able to slip into places that most adults could not</p>

        <p> The home lives of people during this time was not much better. Most of the people during this time lived in slums of cities in tiny cramped houses with public bathrooms and open showers. During this time there was also the rise of the middle class
            with people who were specialized in new roles thanks to mass production. These jobs were those of doctors, lawyers and shop clerks. These people had it good compared to the working class but nowhere near as good as the upper class. The upper
            class during this time were often politicians and factory owners and made money from their factories and the stock market, which gave them to oportunity to win big or lose hard.

            The safety of factory works relates heavily back to the video "The Monkey Business Illusion" and the TED Talk "Does money make you mean? | Paul Piff". The whole situation with the factory workers is the excat thing that Piff was talking about. THe factory
            owners have closed off their hearts in the persute of money. This is backed up by the Invisible illution which is when someone consectrates on one thing that they miss key details ok when they find one they still are missing many more. These
            two things combined paints the picture that once people learned of the weath that could be made off of factories, the owners got too focused on making money that they were not able to see the pain and suffering that was happening and stopped
            seeing or caring about it. Even though factories are a great opportunity to make money i was also a very unnecessarily risky leading to the unnecessary loss of life
